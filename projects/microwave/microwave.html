            The microwave oven is a common appliance that heats up foods quickly, and its interface seeks to provide an
            effortless, mess-free, and hands-off cooking experience. 
          </p>
          <p class="descr">
            But is that the reality of users' experiences? I conducted some user research to find out, and created two personas 
            and a storyboard that could help to inform a better microwave design.

      <div class="row container-fluid pb-5 wide">

            <h4>Celine</h4>
            <p>
                Celine is a mother of two who cooks for the whole family. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Celine uses the microwave to heat up leftovers. She uses the number pad to set time quickly and decisively, but hesitates just
                before pressing start. She leaves to get a napkin to cover the plate, and then starts the microwave.
            </p>
            <p>
                While microwave is running, Celine stretches her legs, then checks her phone for messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Celine is at first unsatisfied by the food's temperature, and adds an extra 20 seconds of cooking time. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Celine usually uses the microwave 2 to 3 times a day, and finds it quick to use and easy to clean up after. Celine says that while she enjoys cooking, she finds it time consuming.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Celine finds it difficult to estimate the heating time needed, and often needs to add more time to get the desired temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many buttons on the microwave that Celine does not find useful. She only uses "start" and the number pad to set time. 
                She does not use any of the other buttons (eg. power level, 
                preset cooking modes) – she is not sure what they do, and isn't interested in finding out.

            <h4>Momoka</h4>
            <p>
                Momoka is a college student living at home.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Momoka microwaves a bowl of instant ramen for lunch. She pours water into the ramen bowl, reads the instructions on the packaging,
                and quickly enters in the instructed time.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the ramen cooks, she does some squats in the kitchen, and then leans against the counter and does some counter push-ups.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the microwave timer is up, she carefully lifts the steaming noodles out,
                struggling to carry the bowl because of the heat.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Momoka says that she wants to learn to cook, but doesn’t do it often because it is time consuming. 
                She finds the microwave to be a fast and convenient cooking appliance, particularly for days where she has little time betweeen classes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The only buttons that she uses are the number pads, start, and power level. She has never used settings for prepackaged foods (eg. frozen meals, 
                pizza), despite microwaving prepackaged foods often.

                Rafael is a college student living off-campus on his own.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Rafael grabs a frozen pre-made burrito from the freezer and puts it directly into the microwave. 
                He quickly and decisively sets the time, changes the power level, and then presses the start button.
            </p>
            <p>
                While microwave is running, leans on kitchen counter and checks his phone – reads emails, news, then plays game.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the microwave beeps, he immediately takes out the burrito but burns his hands a little, and tosses the burrito around like a hot potato.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p>
                Rafael describes cooking as “not my favorite”. On average, he uses the microwave 2-4 a day 
                for lunch, dinner, and snacks. He doesn’t usually know exactly how long to microwave items for, and adds more time as he goes.
            </p>
            <p>
                His most used buttons are the power-level button, the “set 1min” shortcut, and start. He never uses any preset buttons for frozen meals, 
                even when cooking frozen meals, and he also finds the light button unnecessary.

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p class="descr">
                It seems that while users generally agree on the efficiency and ease of microwave cooking, the interface also contains many 
                options and buttons that are not well understood and rarely used - perhaps its interface could be further simplified, 
                and its unintuitive functionalities made more learnable. 
            </p>
            <p class="descr">
                I gained a much deeper understanding of users' interaction patterns with microwaves through this research, and the personas 
                and the storyboard can help to inform better designs for a microwave that is more reflective of how people use it in everyday life.
