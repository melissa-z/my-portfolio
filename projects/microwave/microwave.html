            The microwave oven is a common interface that provides a solution to heating up foods both quickly and efficiently. 
            It attempts to provide a hands-off cooking experience that is effortless, mess-free, and quick, but that may not always be
            the reality of users' experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            To investigate how people perceive and interact with microwaves, I first began with a quick sketch of a microwave.
            A microwave's key components consist of a pull handle that opens a rectangular chamber, a number pad to set time with, a start button, 
            a stop/clear button, and various preset setting options.

            To better understand how people interact with the microwave, I observed three users using microwaves in their everyday lives. I then 
            interviewed the users with a list of questions to gain insight about their experience, expectations, motives, and challenges 
            while using the interface.

              Celine usually uses the microwave 2 to 3 times 
              a day, for breakfast and dinner. She finds the microwave quick to use and easy to clean up after. Celine says that while she enjoys cooking, she finds it very time consuming. If her kids are hungry or if she's exhausted, she resorts to 
              microwaving leftovers.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Celine feels that it is difficult to estimate the heating tiime needed, and often needs to add more time multiple times to get the desired temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many buttons on the microwave that Celine does not find useful. The only buttons 
              that she uses on are "start" and the number pads to set time. She does not use any of the other buttons (eg. power level, 
              preset cooking modes) – she is not sure what they do, and isn't interested in finding out. While the microwave runs, she stretches 
              her legs and checks her phone for messages. She does not clean her microwave, unless something has exploded and made a mess.

              Momoka is a college student living at home. She says that she wants to learn to cook, but doesn’t do it often because it is time consuming. 
              She uses the microwave 3 times a day, for breakfast, lunch, and snacks in the afternoon. In the morning with her breakfast, she microwaves her water 
              for 20sec to lukewarmness. At lunch, she microwaves an instant ramen bowl, which takes 4 minutes. In the afternoon, she uses the microwave to make a 
              snack, usually a mug cake. 
            </p1>
            <p>
                Momoka finds the microwave to be a fast and easy cooking appliance, particularly for days where she has little time betweeen classes. She has a good idea of how long each item needs to be microwaved, and almost never finds it necessary to add more time/take 
                food out early. The only buttons that she uses are the number pads, start, and power level. She doesn't know exactly what the other settings do. While the microwave is running, she does some counter push-ups and some squats in the kitchen. She does not clean her microwave.

              Rafael is a college student living off campus. He describes cooking as “not my favorite”. On average, he uses the microwave 2-4 a day, 
              for lunch, dinner, and snacks.  At lunch he usually microwaves a frozen burrito between classes. For dinner, he sometimes uses the microwave 
              to make frozen microwave meals or heat up leftovers. Later in the evenings, he often microwaves popcorn as a late night snack. The majority of 
              the foods take over a minute to microwave, but he doesn’t usually know exactly how long to microwave them for, and he adjusts/adds more time as he 
              goes.
            </p1>
            <p>
                His most used buttons are the power-level button, the “set 1min” shortcut, and start. He never uses any preset buttons for frozen meals, 
                even when cooking frozen meals, and he also finds the light button unnecessary. While the microwave runs, he checks his phone for emails, news, 
                and games. He does not clean his microwave unless something explodes and gets messy.
