            <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2><span class="highlight-2">Introduction</span></h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of students interested in using tech for social good, we stumbled upon a startup named Ayana, and were deeply inspired by its mission. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ayana is a mobile app platform that matches minorities and marginalized peoples with therapists of similar identities. Each user takes a culturally sensitive questionnaire 
                    that pairs them with a primary therapist, reducing the chance of misdiagnosis and connecting them with diverse licensed professionals. Our group was drawn to Ayana's unique 
                    approach to mental health, and we liked how it centers therapist-patient relationships around their shared experiences. 
                    More information about Ayana here: <a href="https://www.ayanatherapy.com">https://www.ayanatherapy.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the interface of Ayana's mobile app is not yet fully developed, and we sought to use iterative design to create a new user experience for the clients of Ayana.         
                </p>
                <h3><span class="highlight-25">Interface/Users</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Since Ayana is a mobile app, we designed a mobile interface. We identified Ayana's target audience as intersectional minorities who may be experiencing mental health issues, and we determined this app would facilitate patient-therapist relationships through accessibility (specifically a streamlined scheduling process) and personalized matching.
                </p>
                <h3><span class="highlight-25">Sketches</span></h3>
                <p>First, our group drew up four sets of initial sketches for the app. We didn't look at the actual Ayana app (which is currently published to a limited audience) to avoid inadvertently copying the app's design. We tried to include a wide variety of layouts to explore as many options as possible.</p>
                <p>Potential key pages we identified were as follows:</p>
                <div class="pages row flex flex-wrap">
                    <div class="col-4">

                            <li>Create an account/login</li>
                            <li>Patient-therapist matching questionnaire</li>
                            <li>Therapist profiles</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2><span class="highlight-3">Lo-fi Wireframes</span></h2>
                <p>Based on our sketches, we created a set of low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to concretize our initial ideas. Since we used Figma rather than wireframing software like Balsamiq, our biggest challenge during this phase was keeping the mockups low-fidelity.</p>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <iframe

            <div class="section">
                <h2><span class="highlight-4">Hi-fi Prototypes</span></h2>
                <p>Next, we transformed our lo-fi wireframes to hi-fi prototypes in Figma. This was the stage when we started considering style elements (eg. color palette, typography, aesthetics) and added detailed interactions (eg. confirmation modals, input overlays). We created additional pages as needed, using Figma's prototyping tool to mimic user interactions with the app.</p>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

                <h2><span class="highlight-5">Critique and Iteration</span></h2>
                <p>
                    We presented our hifi mockups to an industry critic and our peers in our user interface and user experience class to receive feedback on the designs and prototypes that we had created. 
                    This was really useful in helping us improve our designs because it allowed us to understand how new users would interact with and interpret our designs.
                </p>
                <p>Some key points of feedback that we received and our solutions to those issues:</p>

                            The effect of the "Cancel" button is unclear: does it close the appointment popup or cancel the appointment itself?

                        <div class="solution col-6">
                            "Cancel" was rephrased to "Cancel Appointment", and added an "X" on the top right of the appointment popup to close the popup.

                <p>By examining their behavior and interactions with the mockups when asked to complete these tasks, we found that the overall structure of our mockup was quite effective. Here are some key findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most users noted that they recognized exactly where to look to accomplish the tasks we asked for and that they enjoyed the smooth and easy follow flow between pages and tasks. </li>
                    <li>Generally our users were able to complete the task quickly and effectively with no difficulties or mistakes.</li>
                    <li>One user did not actually click on a time slot to book an appointment and believed that she had already booked it once arriving at the therapists page. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Following the completion of these tasks, we asked the users to answer these questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What <b><span class="highlight-6">frustrated</span></b> you most about this app?</li>

                    <li>What did you <b><span class="highlight-6">like</span></b> most about the app?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ultimately, our three testers provided mostly positive feedback. All three liked the visual layout of the app and found it comprehensive and easy to navigate and use. One user suggested that we could include more integration with other applications such as google maps and google calendar to make it even easier for the user, which would definitely be a great addition for the next iteration of this design. Another thing that we would change in the next iteration would be adding more affordances to guide users through their interactions, and rephrasing some of the titles of our sections to be more explicit and intuitive.</p>

                <p>Finally, we reached out to the original startup over email. In the email, we introduced ourselves, included a link to the hi-fi prototype, and explained the motivation behind our UIUX design choices. </p>

                <p>This project was a great chance to apply UIUX principles in a real-world context, and our team had a lot of fun throughout the design process. The group format was an amazing opportunity to both collaborate with fellow UIUX students while learning from each other; moreover, the fact that we were basing our designs off a real startup made our project feel that much more impactful. Overall, this project was a great exercise in design, teamwork, and creativity.</p>
